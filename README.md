# Written description of 3 observable trends in the dataset

1.  Males are the predominate gender of people that play Heroes of Pymoli. Either by design or by chance, there are clearly elements of the game that are more attractive to males. Male players make up 84.03% of Heroes of Pymoli players. A percentage well above the U.S. national average for 2019 (54%), per "Distribution of computer and video gamers in the United States from 2006 to 2019, by gender" statistics.

2.  Spending and age groups may be correlated. Players between the ages of 20 to 24 hold the highest percentage of players (44.79%) and as a group contribute to $1,114.06 -- just under half the total revenue ($2,379.77). Moreover, the number of players increases towards the ages of 20-24 and decreases as the players become older. It seems that it would be advantageous to have the ability to purchase items, which would increase your in-game capabilities. Additionally, the 20-24 age group has shown to be the age group young adults begin to earn a more stable income and in principle have obtained disposable income. 

3.  Though male players significantly outnumber female players, female players purchase more items per person than males. A statistic overlooked in the assignment. We need to then group the data by 'Age Group' and 'Gender' to determine how to attract more female players. Other/Non-disclosed gendered players purchase more on average than males per person. However, this group contributes to 2% of total revenue -- a sample size far too small to be considered without further investigation.
